# GradeComputer
This is a personal project, a program I'm writing using C++ that can be used by students to analyze their current standing in a
college or high school course (regardless of course setup). This is a work in progress.

At this moment, there are 9 outputs that the user can request after inputting their grades. I am in the process of implementing
the last output option.

Once I get the program working via manual grade entry, there are 2 features that I would like to implement:

(1) I would like to enable the user to input grades via a text file, to make grade entry less annoying (especially for repeated
use).

(2) The current program version simply asks for output and input through the terminal. I would like to convert it to a graphical 
application through wxSmith in CodeBlocks, to make it more visually appealing to the average user.
